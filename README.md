# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Nico! I started learning HTML and CSS when I was about 11 when I was first introduced to the very basics of HTML on Neopets of all places. I then taught myself HTML and CSS via dissecting the code on different websites to figure out what each line was doing and how it changed the resulting website. I spent my middle school and high school years building dozens of websites, both personal pages and blogs as well as a variety of sites about my favorite shows, movies, and books. I learned some JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL during those years as well.

Now as an adult, I'm brushing up on the more recent developments with HTML and CSS, as well as learning new languages and more about cybersecurity. My current plan is to complete both paths (Full Stack JavaScript and Full Stack Ruby on Rails) of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/), and then do further some learning on [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/). I plan on working on personal projects afterwards, and potentially pursuing a B.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governors University if I decide to go into cybersecurity full time.
